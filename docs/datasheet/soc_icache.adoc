**Overview**

The processor features an optional CPU instruction cache. The cache is connected directly to the CPU's instruction
fetch interface and provides full-transparent accesses. The cache is direct-mapped and read-only.
The cache uses <<_locked_bus_accesses_and_bursts>> to download cache blocks/lines from main memory.
In the <<_dual_core_configuration>> each CPU core is equipped with a private instruction cache.

The instruction cache is implemented if `ICACHE_EN` it _true_. The total cache memory size in bytes is defined by
`ICACHE_NUM_BLOCKS x CACHE_BLOCK_SIZE`. `ICACHE_NUM_BLOCKS` defines the number of cache blocks (or "cache lines")
and `CACHE_BLOCK_SIZE` defines the block size in bytes; note that this configuration is global for all caches.

.Burst Transfers
[IMPORTANT]
If the cache is activated, this also means that cache block transfers are **always executed as burst transfers**.
There is no possibility to execute the cache block transfers as single bus transactions. Therefore, all devices,
memories and endpoints that can be accessed by the cache must also be able to process bursts.

.Uncached Accesses
[NOTE]
The cache provides direct/uncached accesses to memory (bypassing the cache) in order to access memory-mapped IO (like the
processor-internal IO/peripheral modules). All accesses that target the address range from `0xF0000000` to `0xFFFFFFFF`
will bypass the cache. Hence, access will not be cached. See section <<_address_space>> for more information. Furthermore,
the atomic memory operations of the <<_zaamo_isa_extension>> will always **bypass** the cache.

.Manual Cache Clear/Reload and Memory Coherence
[NOTE]
By executing the `fence.i` instruction the instruction cache is cleared and reloaded.
See section <<_memory_coherence>> for more information.

.Cache Block Update Fault Handling
[NOTE]
If the cache encounters a bus error when downloading a new block from main memory, the
entire block is invalidated and a bus access error exception is raised.

.Retrieve Cache Configuration from Software
[TIP]
Software can retrieve the cache configuration/layout from the <<_sysinfo_cache_configuration>> register.
